# Python Project — To-Do List Application 🐍
---
I’m excited to share my project in Python, which I developed as part of my internship at **CodSoft**! 🎉

The project is a *To-Do List Application* — a simple yet effective tool that helps users manage and organize their daily tasks efficiently.

---
The app allows users to:
✅ Add new tasks
✅ View all tasks
✅ Mark tasks as done
✅ Delete tasks
✅ Automatically save tasks using a JSON file
---

I built it using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and also explored Python’s new match / case statement for creating a clean and modern menu system.

---
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
💡 Class-based design and code organization
💡 File handling and data persistence with JSON
💡 Writing clean, readable, and modular Python code
---

It’s a small step, but I’m proud of this beginning — seeing my code actually work feels amazing! 😄

A big thanks to **CodSoft** for this opportunity and for helping me grow as a developer. 🙏
